//! Yet Another Abstract Algebra Rust Crate.
//!
//! I have some free time so I want to try to implement my own abstract algebra library with the
//! eventual goal of writing an algorithm to compute
//! [GrÃ¶bner basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis).
//!
//! Throughout, we will be referring to "sets". By that, we mean types. Specifically, the difference
//! between sets and types doesn't matter here. A type which can implement a ring will still model a
//! set.

pub mod grouplike;
pub mod latticelike;
pub mod operators;
pub mod ringlike;

pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -> u64 {
    left + right
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
